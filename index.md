### WTF is JaSON?
JaSON is a handy Chrome plugin that lets you to send and receive JSON and XML from your browser to web services around the internet. Instead of having to write code or hack on command line tools like curl, you can use JaSON to explore an API with a few easy clicks. It's free, easy to use and takes only a few seconds to install.

### Sounds awesome! Where do I get it?
You can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jason/oealdlhfjifhgbmjnenhkgffglaibojf).

### Ok, done. Now what do I do?
An example is probably the best way to demonstrate. Let's assume you want to explore the [OpenWeatherMap API](http://openweathermap.org/API#weather).

To get the weather in Sydney Australia, you can simply enter the following URL and hit send.

```
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Sydney,Australia
```

Boom! You'll get a nicely formatted response. You're welcome :)

Let's try a few other things.

### More coming soon...
