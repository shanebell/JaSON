### Cookie support ###
Automatically sends cookies from Chrome. This is extremely handy for APIs which require authentication. Simply authenticate via your browser as normal and JaSON will send cookies for requests which match.

### HTTP methods ###
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS

### Request history ###
Keeps request history with full text search. Individual history items can be deleted, or marked as a "favourite" for easy access. History from previous versions of JaSON will be automatically migrated. Stores history in IndexedDB for improved performance.

### Dark/light theme ###
Change the colour theme to suit your work environment.

### Formatted input/output ###
Provides an IDE like experience when editing request body and headers. Automatically formats request/response body syntax and colour based on content type.

### Content type ###
Supports JSON, XML, and form encoded data by default. Additional content types can be used by setting a custom content type header.

### New and improved ###
Completely re-written, new styling, layout, colours, additional features and improved performance.

### 100% open source ###
Source code is available from GitHub.
